# Spectra - AI Agent & Workflow System

Spectra is a system of specialized AI agents and workflow rules. Use it with Claude, Cursor, or any AI tool to get expert-level help on any software engineering task.

## Quick Start

1. **Install via npm:**
   ```bash
   npm install spectra-ai
   ```

2. **Tell your AI tool:**
   ```
   Please act as the workflow defined in: ./.spectra/rules/workflow_v4.md
   ```

3. **Describe your task** - The AI will use the right agent to help.

## Triggers - How to Use Spectra

Use triggers to tell the AI what type of work you need. Include the trigger in your request:

```
-l to build a new feature
```

### All Triggers & Commands

| Trigger | Command | Sub-Version | Use For |
|---------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **`-init`** | `-init` | Mode A: Fresh Project | New project, no code/docs → AI asks all questions |
| | `-init docs/` | Mode B: From Docs | Have existing documentation → AI reads + creates context |
| | `-init --existing` | Mode C: Auto-Detect | Have code → AI scans + auto-creates context |
| **`-l`** | `-l [feature name]` | — | Large feature: specify → plan → implement → review |
| **`-s`** | `-s [task name]` | — | Small task: plan → implement → review |
| **`-q`** | `-q [change]` | — | Quick change: single file, minimal planning |
| **`-us`** | `-us [feature]` | — | User story: define with diagrams + acceptance criteria |
| **`-d`** | `-d [topic]` | — | Discussion: expert advice (read-only) |
| **`-fix`** | `-fix` | — | Fix error: debug + fix + verify |
| **`-ask`** | `-ask [question]` | — | Explain code: read + explain flow + flag issues |
| **`-review`** | `-review` | — | Code review: check quality (read-only) |
| **`-db`** | `-db [task]` | — | Database: schema + migrations + seeders |
| **`-update`** | `-update [file]` | — | Update docs: modify existing MD files |
| **`-g`** | `-g` | Full Workflow | Create branch → commit → push → create PR |
| | `-g --simple` | Simple Push | Commit → push to current branch (no PR) |
| | `-g --simple [branch]` | Push to Branch | Commit → push to specified branch |
| **`-help`** | `-help` | — | Show all triggers |



## When to Use Each Trigger

**Planning & Discovery:**
- `-init` — Starting a new project? Initialize context first
- `-us` — Defining a new feature? Start with user story
- `-d` — Need expert advice? Use discussion mode (read-only)

**Building Features:**
- `-l` — Building a full feature? Use large task (full workflow)
- `-s` — Small feature or fix? Use small task (faster)
- `-q` — One-line change? Use quick task

**Code Quality:**
- `-review` — Review code before merging? Use code review
- `-ask` — Understand existing code? Read and explain
- `-fix` — Something broken? Diagnose and fix

**Specialized Work:**
- `-db` — Schema changes, migrations? Use database engineer
- `-g` — Commit and push? Use git operations
- `-update` — Change docs/specs? Update existing files
