# Spectra - AI Agent & Workflow System

Spectra is a system of specialized AI agents and workflow rules. Use it with Claude, Cursor, or any AI tool to get expert-level help on any software engineering task.

## The Problem Spectra Solves

When you hit message limits or token limits on Claude, Cursor, or Copilot, you switch to another AI tool (Gemini CLI, Copilot, Antigravity, etc.). But the new tool doesn't know what happened before — it loses all context about your project.

If the previous AI completed only half a task, the next AI starts from zero and doesn't know:
- What you're building
- What decisions were made
- What code patterns you use
- What task was being worked on
- What's already done and what's left

So you waste time re-explaining everything, or the new AI breaks your code because it doesn't understand your project.

**Spectra's Solution:**

Spectra automatically saves everything in a `docs/` folder in your project:
- **Project overview** — what you're building, your tech stack
- **Progress** — what's done, what's being worked on, what's next
- **Decisions** — code patterns, conventions, rules you follow
- **Preferences** — your style, file sizes, naming rules

When you switch to a different AI tool, it reads the `docs/` folder first and knows exactly where the last AI left off. You can switch from Claude → Cursor → Copilot → Gemini CLI without losing context.

## Quick Start

1. **Install via npm:**
   ```bash
   npm install spectra-ai
   ```

2. **Tell your AI tool:**
   ```
   Please act as the workflow defined in: ./.spectra/rules/workflow_v4.md
   ```

3. **Describe your task** - The AI will use the right agent to help.

## Triggers - How to Use Spectra

Use triggers to tell the AI what type of work you need. Include the trigger in your request:

```
-l to build a new feature
```

### All Triggers & Commands

| Trigger | Command | Sub-Version | Use For |
|---------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **`-init`** | `-init` | Mode A: Fresh Project | New project, no code/docs → AI asks all questions |
| | `-init docs/` | Mode B: From Docs | Have existing documentation → AI reads + creates context |
| | `-init --existing` | Mode C: Auto-Detect | Have code → AI scans + auto-creates context |
| **`-l`** | `-l [feature name]` | — | Large feature: specify → plan → implement → review |
| **`-s`** | `-s [task name]` | — | Small task: plan → implement → review |
| **`-q`** | `-q [change]` | — | Quick change: single file, minimal planning |
| **`-us`** | `-us [feature]` | — | User story: define with diagrams + acceptance criteria |
| **`-d`** | `-d [topic]` | — | Discussion: expert advice (read-only) |
| **`-fix`** | `-fix` | — | Fix error: debug + fix + verify |
| **`-ask`** | `-ask [question]` | — | Explain code: read + explain flow + flag issues |
| **`-review`** | `-review` | — | Code review: check quality (read-only) |
| **`-db`** | `-db [task]` | — | Database: schema + migrations + seeders |
| **`-update`** | `-update [file]` | — | Update docs: modify existing MD files |
| **`-g`** | `-g` | Full Workflow | Create branch → commit → push → create PR |
| | `-g --simple` | Simple Push | Commit → push to current branch (no PR) |
| | `-g --simple [branch]` | Push to Branch | Commit → push to specified branch |
| **`-help`** | `-help` | — | Show all triggers |



## When to Use Each Trigger

**Planning & Discovery:**
- `-init` — Starting a new project? Initialize context first
- `-us` — Defining a new feature? Start with user story
- `-d` — Need expert advice? Use discussion mode (read-only)

**Building Features:**
- `-l` — Building a full feature? Use large task (full workflow)
- `-s` — Small feature or fix? Use small task (faster)
- `-q` — One-line change? Use quick task

**Code Quality:**
- `-review` — Review code before merging? Use code review
- `-ask` — Understand existing code? Read and explain
- `-fix` — Something broken? Diagnose and fix

**Specialized Work:**
- `-db` — Schema changes, migrations? Use database engineer
- `-g` — Commit and push? Use git operations
- `-update` — Change docs/specs? Update existing files

### Example Usages

**Step 1: Initialize Workflow (Do this once)**
```
Please act as the workflow defined in: ./.spectra/rules/workflow_v4.md
```

Then use any trigger below:

**`-init`**
```
-init
```

**`-init docs/`**
```
-init docs/
```

```
-init --existing
```

**`-l [feature]`**
```
-l build a real-time chat system
```

**`-s [task]`**
```
-s add user profile avatars
```

**`-q [change]`**
```
-q fix the typo in UserModel.ts
```

**`-us [feature]`**
```
-us email notification feature
```

**`-d [topic]`**
```
-d review if this API design is scalable
```

**`-fix`**
```
-fix TypeError at line 42 in payment.service.ts
```

**`-ask [question]`**
```
-ask explain how the authentication flow works
```

**`-review`**
```
-review
```

**`-db [task]`**
```
-db add an orders table with migration
```

**`-g`**
```
-g
```

**`-g --simple`**
```
-g --simple
```

**`-g --simple [branch]`**

## Available Agents

Choose the agent that matches your task:

| Agent | Use When | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 🏗️ **backend-engineer** | Building APIs, servers, databases | "Design a REST API", "Optimize database queries", "Set up authentication" |
| 🎨 **frontend-engineer** | Building UIs, components, web pages | "Create a React component", "Fix CSS layout", "Build a dashboard" |
| 📊 **database-engineer** | Schema design, migrations, queries | "Design a user schema", "Write an efficient query", "Plan a migration" |
| ✅ **code-reviewer** | Code quality, best practices, bugs | "Review this code", "Check for security issues", "Optimize performance" |
| 🧪 **qa-debugger** | Testing, debugging, validation | "Debug this error", "Write tests", "Trace a bug" |
| 📋 **product-manager** | Requirements, scope, planning | "Define requirements", "Clarify scope", "Plan a feature" |
| 🧠 **domain-expert** | Business logic, validation | "Validate this solution", "Check business rules", "Domain expertise" |




## Installation

**Local Installation** (Recommended)
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
npm install spectra-ai
```

After installation, the `.spectra` folder will automatically appear in your project root.

**Troubleshooting: Package installs in home node_modules instead of project**

If npm is installing packages globally (in home directory) instead of your project:

1. **Check npm configuration:**
   ```bash
   npm config get prefix
   ```

2. **Reset npm to use local project folder:**
   ```bash
   npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global
   npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
   ```

3. **Make sure you're NOT using -g flag:**
   ```bash
   npm install spectra-ai    # ✅ Correct (local)
   npm install -g spectra-ai # ❌ Wrong (global)
   ```

4. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   ls -la node_modules/spectra-ai
   ls -la .spectra
   ```

Your project structure should look like:
```
my-project/
├── node_modules/
│   └── spectra-ai/
├── .spectra/              ← Auto-copied here
└── package.json
```
